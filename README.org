* Lin's Utility library

  This library contains a set of data structures, algorithms that I found to be useful in many different projects. So I decided to rewrite those code that I developped to make them generic enough to be potentially used in any projects.

* Current contents

** LRU cache

** Deadline cache

** A Prefix tree 
   The trie can be used to index strings of any alphabet whose size is less than 256. It is fast and memory efficient.

** A data classifier
   It can be used to find "similar" data segements in a stream. 

* TODOs

** Concurrent B-Tree

** Suffix Tree

** Ternary Tree

** Data classifier by using levenshtein automaton 

** A cache framework that allow uses to define their own index algorithms and expire policies.

** More documentations (The hardest work for me since I hate it!)
