* Lin's Utility library

  This library contains a set of data structures, algorithms that I found to be useful in many different projects. So I decided to rewrite those code that I developped to make them generic enough to be potentially used in any projects.
  
* Current contents
  1. LRU cache
  2. Deadline cache
  3. A Prefix tree
  4. A data classifier
  5. A lock-free leaky bucket counter

* TODOs

  1. Concurrent B-Tree
  2. Suffix Tree
  3. HMAP table
  4. Ternary Tree
  5. Data classifier by using levenshtein automation
  6. A cache framework that allow uses to define their own index algorithms and expire policies.
  7. More documentations (The hardest work for me since I hate it!)
